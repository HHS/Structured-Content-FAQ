<h1>Health and Human Services (HHS) Drupal Content Type Library: FAQ</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The FAQ content type is used for content in question and answer format. The Q&A structure allows for consistent styling and recognized user experience across the website. Each Q&A is entered into separate question and answer fields, allowing for the possibility of reuse or syndication of an individual FAQ.

<h2>Content Type Details</h2>
Contained in the /documentation folder are the content model for the FAQ content type (HHS-Structured-Content-Type-FAQ.xlsx) which includes the Drupal field names used and their matching schema.org metadata name; and a Word Template (HHS-Structured-Content-Type-Template-FAQ.docx) which is a guidance document we provide to content owners to complete whenever they want an FAQ to be created. The Template includes all of the fields that must be completed in order to create the FAQ, as well as a taxonomy list to reference as they fill in those fields that require a taxonomy term.

<h2>Drupal Features Module</h2>
